Monash FIT2095 Coding examples and resources

## Information
This repository will likely be more Wiki based, but let's see if we can't get some coding examples covered.

## IDE I use
I use IntelliJ as it provides support for Node.js and has a really nice interface. 
.. and Free for students ;)

- [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- [Student License](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)
- [Github Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
