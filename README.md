# FIT2095 E-business Software Technologies
Monash FIT2095 Coding examples and resources

## Update For Exams

Please find all workshop quizzes and Pre-reading quizzes on the Wiki pages:

https://github.com/Benehiko/FIT2095/wiki


## PLEASE NOTE THAT LABS USED TO BE MARKED AS eg. Lab 8 for Week 9. On Moodle it will say Lab 9 Week 9. Here it won't be updated.

## Information
This repository will likely be more Wiki based, but let's see if we can't get some coding examples covered.

After some investigation I believe that submodules would work the most optimal since there are different tasks / labs etc.
You can thus create private github repositories when working on a lab and then expose it to the public after the week has passed to 'release answers', then sub-module it into the forked repository from where you can do a pull request into this repository.

**Please look at 'Submodules'**

## IDE I use
I use IntelliJ as it provides support for Node.js and has a really nice interface. 
.. and Free for students ;)
